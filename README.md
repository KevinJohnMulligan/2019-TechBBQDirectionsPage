# 2019-TechBBQDirectionsPage
 I was tasked with creating the directions page for an event called TechBBQ China which took place at TroubleMaker in HuaQiangBei, Shenzhen. TechBBQ is a unique summit gathering investors, corporations, startups and everything in between.  TechBBQ China was organised in cooperation with TechBBQ Denmark and sponsored by Innovation House Asia and the Nordic-China Startup Forum.
